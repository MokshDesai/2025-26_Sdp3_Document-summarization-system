##  Date: 12 December - 2025 (lab01)


###  Overview
On this date,  focused on understanding, designing, and setting up the foundation for a Document Summarization System using Django.  
The work primarily involved learning Django project structure, frontend–backend integration, text extraction from documents, and core NLP summarization concepts.



##  Topics Learned



### 1. Django Project Structure & Full-Stack Flow
- Understood the difference between a **Django project** and a **Django app**.
- Learned the purpose of key Django files:
  - settings.py** – project-level configuration  
  - urls.py – URL routing  
  - views.py – backend logic  
  - templates/ – frontend HTML files
- Understood how Django templates are used for frontend rendering.
- Learned how frontend (**HTML + JavaScript**) communicates with backend views in Django.
- Clarified that:
  - Frontend code is stored in the `templates/` directory
  - Backend logic is handled in `views.py`



### 2. Text Extraction from Documents
- Learned how text extraction varies based on document type:
  - Text-based PDFs → extracted using **PyPDF2**
  - DOCX files → extracted using **python-docx**
  - Scanned PDFs / images → require OCR
- Understood the importance of OCR (Optical Character Recognition) for scanned documents.
- Installed and verified the following extraction tools on macOS:
  - PyPDF2
  - python-docx
  - pytesseract
  - Tesseract OCR (system-level)
  - pdf2image
  - Pillow
- Learned how to verify OCR functionality using:
  - `tesseract --version`
  - `pytesseract.get_tesseract_version()`



### 3. NLP & Summarization Concepts
- Understood the difference between:
  - Text extraction
  - Text cleaning
  - Text chunking
  - Text summarization
- Learned about **abstractive summarization**.
- Studied the facebook/bart-large-cnn model:
  - Its role in summarizing extracted text
  - Why it is suitable for general-purpose document summarization
- Learned about token limits in NLP models and why long documents must be split into chunks.
- Understood the need for **text cleaning** before summarization to remove noise and formatting issues.



### 4. System Architecture Understanding
Designed and understood the overall workflow of the system:

User Uploads Document
        ↓
Django Frontend (HTML + JavaScript)
        ↓
Django Backend (views.py)
        ↓
Text Extraction (PDF / DOCX / OCR)
        ↓
Text Cleaning & Chunking
        ↓
Summarization Model (BART – local)
        ↓
Summary Displayed to User
